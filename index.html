        <p>Polygraph is an open source Java famework that allows you to setup, manage and send professional newsletters in various ways and formats to your customers. It  uses and requires <a href="http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/">FreeMarker</a>-Templates
        to generate the output. You can use it as standalone solution or embed it into existing systems.</p>
